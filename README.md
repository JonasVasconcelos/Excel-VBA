## Summary <a name="summary"></a>
The Fishing Landing Data Logger is an Excel file configured with macros written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to create a friendly and optimized interface for recording fishing landing data. In addition, the system has tabs for "New Registrations" and "Biometrics". The first records new locations, vessels, and species for the system to recognize and use in the "Landing" tab. The second logs the basics morphometric information (total/standard length and total/evaluated weight), plus sex, maturation, and which biological materials were collected (otolith, gonads, and/or stomachs).
